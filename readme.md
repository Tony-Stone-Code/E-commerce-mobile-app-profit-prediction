## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language used for data analysis and model training.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: For enhanced visualizations and statistical graphics.
- **Scikit-learn**: For implementing the linear regression model.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains various features related to the e-commerce platform, including but not limited to:
- User engagement metrics (e.g., daily active users, session duration)
- App performance indicators (e.g., load time, crash reports)
- Historical profit data (e.g., monthly profit)
- Marketing spend (e.g., advertising budget)
- Customer feedback ratings (e.g., app store ratings)

The dataset is structured in a CSV format and can be found in the `dataset/` directory. Ensure that the dataset is cleaned and preprocessed before running the model.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone git clone https://github.com/Tony-Stone-Code/GO2COD_DS_02.git

## Model Training
The linear regression model was trained using the following steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Handled missing values by filling or dropping them.
Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding.
Scaled numerical features using standardization or normalization.
Data Splitting:

Divided the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training:

Fitted the linear regression model to the training data using Scikit-learn.
Model Evaluation:

Assessed the model performance using metrics such as R-squared and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).
