    "## INSIGHTS AND TRENDS\n",
    "\n",
    "The following insights can be gained from the analysis of the data:\n",
    "1.  High Average Spending: The mean \"Yearly Amount Spent\" is $499.31, indicating that customers are spending a significant amount on average. This suggests a potentially high-value customer base.\n",
    "2. Consistent Session Length: The average session length of 33.05 minutes is relatively stable, with a small standard deviation. This suggests that customers are engaging with the platform for a reasonable duration on average.\n",
    "3. Time on App vs. Website: The average time spent on the app (12.05 minutes) is significantly less than the time spent on the website (37.06 minutes). This could indicate that the website might be more feature-rich or the app might have a more streamlined, task-oriented design.\n",
    "4. Membership Length: The average membership length of 3.53 years is fairly long, suggesting strong customer loyalty. The relatively low standard deviation indicates that there's a good deal of consistency in how long customers stay members.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Trends and Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Potential Correlation: The 50th percentile (median) for \"Yearly Amount Spent\" ($498.89) is very close to the mean ($499.31). This indicates a fairly symmetrical distribution of spending, with fewer extreme outliers on either side of the average.\n",
    "2. Time Spent on App: While the average time spent on the app is lower than the website, the maximum time spent on the app (15.13 minutes) is relatively close to the maximum time spent on the website (40.01 minutes). This might indicate that some users are engaging deeply with the app, perhaps for specific tasks or features.\n",
    "3. Membership Duration: The maximum membership length of 6.92 years is considerably higher than the average, indicating that some customers have been loyal members for a very long time. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Highlights\n",
    "1. There should be more focus on App Engagement: The relatively lower average time spent on the app could be an area for improvement. Consider exploring ways to enhance app features, provide more personalized content, or offer incentives for increased app usage.\n",
    "2. Customer Retention Strategies: The long average membership length suggests that existing customer retention is already good. However, consider strategies to further incentivize long-term engagement and loyalty, such as tiered rewards programs or exclusive offers for high-value customers.\n",
    "3. Value-Oriented Marketing: The high average spending could be a sign that your customer base is willing to invest in your products or services. You might be able to target them with premium offers or more personalized marketing messages.\n",
